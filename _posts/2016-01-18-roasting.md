The roasting process is a beautiful collision of skill, attention to detail, and a good sense of smell.  Because the bean change

What particular roast is best for me?  Each bean profile will come out a little bit different, but here is a general guide.

* LIGHT - Light roasts are for the morning person who wants a kick of caffeine and enjoys the delightful nuances of coffee that has a lot of floral and citrus characteristics. 
* MEDIUM - The best of both worlds in some sense. A little of the delightful nuances with a fuller body. 
* DARK - Dark roasts are great for that last cup of the day. Lower in caffeine and full-bodied in taste... it makes a great cup for after dinner or with dessert.  Sweeter, fuller, and a bit of chocolate profile. 
* ESPRESSO - Sometimes called Vienna, or French, this is best used in espresso. 

I prefer a Medium/Dark roast for most coffees, but Ethiopia which tastes better in the Light/Medium range (in my opinion). 

We'll roast to your exact specifications, and you'll get your money back if you return the coffee you're dissatisfied with.
